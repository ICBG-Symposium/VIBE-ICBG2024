  VIBE is the all-Ireland research conference for the bioinformatics community.
  ICBG is a student-run genomics research conference that has been organized by
  SFI Centre for Research Training in Genomics Data Science graduate students
  since 2019. This year, ICBG and VIBE are joining forces for a joint conference
  taking place in Galway on December 5th and 6th, 2024! We are looking forward
  to hosting world-class speakers and early-career scientists working on 
  research in multiple areas of bioinformatics, genomics, and systems biology.
  Our talks will be covering a wide range of themes including Methods
  Development, Metagenomics, Agrigenomics, Cancer Genomics, Evolution, and 
  Population Genomics.

Mic léinn ar fad atá ar an gcoiste eagrúcháin <a href='https://icbgsymposium.com/team/'>(féach anseo)</a> as cohórt 3 de Lárionad Fhondúireacht Eolaíochta Éireann (SFI) d’Oiliúint Taighde san Eolaíocht Sonraí Géanómaíochta (CRT GDS). Tá naonúr mac léinn PhD ar an gcoiste as ceithre ollscoil éagsúla: Ollscoil na Gaillimhe; an Coláiste Ollscoile, Baile Átha Cliath; Coláiste na hOllscoile, Corcaigh; agus Coláiste Ríoga na Máinlia in Éirinn. Beidh an siompóisiam ar siúl ón 1 - 2 Nollaig san Aula Maxima ar champas Ollscoil na Gaillimhe den chéad uair ó thosaigh mic léinn an CRT GDS á eagrú. Bhí an chomhdháil ar siúl go fíorúil le dhá bhliain anuas mar gheall ar an bpaindéim."}

Beidh an seisiún seo ar siúl sa tráthnóna ar an gcéad lá den siompóisiam (1 Nollaig). Táimid ag iarraidh go mbeidh na cainteanna sách ginearálta ionas go bhféadfadh lucht féachana nach saineolaithe iad, chomh maith le taighdeoirí bitheolaíocha tairbhe a bhaint as an siompóisiam.  <br> <br>
Is é an aidhm atá ag an togra seo ná go gcuirfeadh sé leis an tuiscint atá ag Gaeilgeoirí ar an ngéanómaíocht agus go dtabharfadh sé deis don phobal labhairt le saineolaithe géanómaíochta agus ceisteanna a chur orthu. Tabharfaidh ár dtogra deis uathúil do phobal na Gaeilge páirt a ghlacadh sa chomhrá maidir leis an ról a bheidh ag an ngéanómaíocht in Éirinn sa todhchaí. Is topaic thábhachtach í an ghéanómaíocht i gcomhthéacs na cógaisíochta; beidh an leigheas géanómaíoch ag teacht chun cinn sna blianta atá amach romhainn agus tá sé tábhachtach go mbeidh an pobal ar an eolas faoin scéal is déanaí sa réimse seo. Freisin, beidh deis ag taighdeoirí labhairt as Gaeilge faoina gcuid taighde. <br> <br>
Má tá baint agat leis an ngéanómaíocht nó leis an ríomh-bhitheolaíocht, agus má tá spéis agat cur i láthair a dhéanamh ar d’ábhar taighde/spéise, is féidir leat achoimre a chur isteach don seisiún seo ag baint úsáid as an Google Form atá le fáil laistigh den chur síos don ticéad ‘Discounted Submission (with Abstract)’ ar eventbrite: <br><br>
