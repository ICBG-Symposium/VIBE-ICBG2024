#### Registration and abstract submission are now open for VIBE/ICBG 2024!

***

##### Registration
Registration is now open and will remain open until 28th of November. You can register to attend via our [EventBrite](https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/vibeicbg-2024-tickets-1015970413857) page, which can also be found here on the [registration page](../registration/) of our website. Registration this year costs €20 (plus a €2.42 EventBrite handling fee) but is **free if you submit an abstract**! After you register, don't forget to take note of the discount code for the [Maldron Hotel](https://www.maldronhotelsandyroadgalway.com/), which will be included in your confirmation email. You can use this code for a discount at the Maldron if you **book before Thursday, 24th of October**. Since our conference takes place in December, we encourage you to book accommodation early before the Galway Christmas Market crowd sets in!

##### Abstracts
Abstract submissions are also open! After you submit an abstract to our abstract portal, we will check that it is valid (no *lorem ipsum*'s please!) and that it meets our formatting requirements (**hint: use subheadings**). Our [submission portal](https://app.oxfordabstracts.com/stages/75796/submitter) has the fine details, but basically:

1. keep it at around 250 words
2. use subheadings
3. choose the thematic category that fits best
4. choose your preferred presentation type (poster, short talk, or lightning talk)

If you don't already have an Oxford Abstracts accounts, you'll have to make one, but it's painless, I promise.

Once we've confirmed that your abstract is ready for review, you will receive an email from info@vibe-icbg.com with your personal EventBrite code to register for the conference **for free**! Note that it might take a day or two before you receive your EventBrite code.

After your submission, our crack team of disgruntled PhD students and their ~~taskmasters~~ supervisors will read and evaluate each abstract with tender love and care. ❤️

##### Social Event
After the first day of the conference wraps up on the 5th of December, we hope you'll join us for a bit of fun in the college bar, Sult. Tickets for this event are €10 (plus €1.70 for the ever-present EventBrite handling fees...) and can be purchased alongside your registration. Grab a bite to eat, network, discuss why there's no train from Connolly to Heuston, start a Python vs. R war, and have some fun!
