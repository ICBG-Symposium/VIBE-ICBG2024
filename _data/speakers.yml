  name: "Dr. Nicholas"
  surname: "McGranahan"
  company: "CRUK-UCL"
  title: "Genomics of Disease and Precision Medicine"
  bio: "Dr Nicholas McGranahan completed his undergraduate degree in Natural Sciences, specializing in Evolutionary Genetics, at the University of Bath before pursuing post-graduate studies at University College London at the Centre of Mathematics and Physics in the Life Science and Experimental Biology (CoMPLEX). In 2011, Dr McGranahan joined Professor Charles Swanton’s group at the CR-UK London Research Institute (now the Francis Crick Institute), completing a PhD in Cancer Genomics in 2015. As a junior group leader within the CRUK Lung Cancer Centre of Excellence, Dr McGranahan’s research interests include using bioinformatics to dissect cancer genome evolution and anti-tumour immunity. His work involves exploring the evolutionary history of cancers through sequencing multiple regions of individual tumours. Dr McGranahan has authored over 40 articles in high impact journals, including first author publications in Science, Nature and Cancer Cell."

  name: "Dr. Nabil"
  surname: "Fareed Alikhan"
  company: "Quadram Institute"
  title: "Microbial Genomics for Health and Industry"
  bio: "Dr. Nabil is a Bioinformatics Scientific Programmer within the Core Bioinformatics / Page group at the Quadram Institute. He has dedicated his professional life to improve bioinformatics analyses and then using these improvements to find new insight into microbial pathogens. Dr. Nabil completed his doctorate in 2015, which focused on comparative genomics of both O157 and non-O157 Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli. He also developed tools and software throughout my PhD, most notably being the the BLAST Ring Image Generator (BRIG). BRIG is a tool for visualizing whole genome comparisons. He then joined Mark Achtman’s group at the University of Warwick where he was a developer on EnteroBase, a web-resource serving over 250,000 genomes; providing genotyping, genome analysis and curated metadata. As of now, Dr. Nabil has joined the Quadram Institute since 2018 and his current duties included developing bioinformatics infrastructure and novel algorithms."
