  name: "Prof. Sandrine"
  surname: "Dudoit"
  company: "University of California, Berkeley"
  title: "Modelling and Systems Biology"
  bio: "Sandrine Dudoit is Associate Dean for the Faculty in the Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society, Professor in the Department of Statistics, and Professor in the Division of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, at the University of California, Berkeley.  Professor Dudoit's methodological research interests regard high-dimensional statistical learning and include exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, loss-based estimation with cross-validation (e.g., density estimation, classification, regression, model selection), and multiple hypothesis testing. Much of her methodological work is motivated by statistical questions arising in biological research and, in particular, the design and analysis of high-throughput sequencing studies, e.g., single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) for discovering novel cell types and for the study of stem cell differentiation. Her contributions include: exploratory data analysis, normalization and expression quantitation, differential expression analysis, class discovery and prediction,  inference of cell lineages, and the integration of biological annotation metadata (e.g., Gene Ontology (GO) annotation). She is also interested in statistical computing and, in particular, computationally reproducible research. She is a founding core developer of the Bioconductor Project (http://www.bioconductor.org), an open-source and open-development software project for the analysis of biomedical and genomic data."
