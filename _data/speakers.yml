  name: "Dr. Nicholas"
  surname: "McGranahan"
  company: "CRUK-UCL"
  title: "Genomics of Disease and Precision Medicine"
  bio: "Dr Nicholas McGranahan completed his undergraduate degree in Natural Sciences, specializing in Evolutionary Genetics, at the University of Bath before pursuing post-graduate studies at University College London at the Centre of Mathematics and Physics in the Life Science and Experimental Biology (CoMPLEX). In 2011, Dr McGranahan joined Professor Charles Swanton’s group at the CR-UK London Research Institute (now the Francis Crick Institute), completing a PhD in Cancer Genomics in 2015.<br> Nicholas established his own research group in 2018 and as a Sir Henry Dale fellow at the UCL-CRUK Lung Cancer Centre of Excellence, his research interests include using bioinformatics to dissect cancer evolution. His team explore the evolutionary history of cancers through sequencing multiple regions of individual tumours. In particular, Dr McGranahan’s research has focused on understanding the importance of genome doubling in tumour evolution, exploring the mutational processes shaping the genomes of cancers over space and time,  and investigating the interface between the cancer genome and the immune microenvironment."

  name: "Professor Sandrine"
  surname: "Dudoit"
  company: "University of California, Berkeley"
  title: "Modelling and Systems Biology"
  bio: "Professor Sandrine Dudoit is Associate Dean for the Faculty in the Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society, Professor in the Department of Statistics, and Professor in the Division of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, at the University of California, Berkeley.  Professor Dudoit's methodological research interests regard high-dimensional statistical learning and include exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, loss-based estimation with cross-validation (e.g., density estimation, classification, regression, model selection), and multiple hypothesis testing. <br>Much of her methodological work is motivated by statistical questions arising in biological research and, in particular, the design and analysis of high-throughput sequencing studies, e.g., single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) for discovering novel cell types and for the study of stem cell differentiation. Her contributions include: exploratory data analysis, normalization and expression quantitation, differential expression analysis, class discovery and prediction,  inference of cell lineages, and the integration of biological annotation metadata (e.g., Gene Ontology (GO) annotation). She is also interested in statistical computing and, in particular, computationally reproducible research. She is a founding core developer of the Bioconductor Project (http://www.bioconductor.org), an open-source and open-development software project for the analysis of biomedical and genomic data."
