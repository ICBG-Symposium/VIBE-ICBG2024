    Growing up as a twin, Micheál was always fascinated by the apparent
    differences between him and his brother. This sparked his interest in
    genetics, and he chose to pursue science for his undergraduate degree at
    University College Dublin. He graduated from UCD in 2021 with a BSc. in
    Cell and Molecular Biology along with a structured elective in Statistics
    and Data Analytics. During this time, he developed an interest in the
    mathematical and statistical side of biology, and so he decided to apply
    to the CRT in Genomics Data Science. His PhD research focuses on
    improving our understanding of disease progression in Acute Myeloid
    Leukaemia patients by developing methods to identify and characterise
    malignant AML cells in single-cell RNA sequencing datasets.

    Javi has a BSc [Honours] in Biotechnology and a MSc in Genetics and
    Evolution from the University of Granada (UGR). During his studies, he was
    awarded a scholarship that allowed him to do an intership at the Biomedical
    Research Centre of the UGR, where he studied the genetic basis of male
    infertility. Here, he was carrying out wet/dry lab research, studying the
    impact that mutations at the SNP level can have on the development of the
    disease.<br><br>

    Javi's current research focuses on studying the molecular landscape of the
    epileptic brain at the single-cell level, investigating whether cell
    type-specific transcriptional changes in neurons and glia contribute to the
    aberrant network function that produces epilepsy.

    Harrison received a MSc from Washington State University in Biology. His
    master’s thesis focused on genome evolution in invasive asexual species.
    His current focus is on the use of population genetics in cancer genomic
    data/models and improving metrics commonly used with cancer data
    (tumor mutation burden, microsatellite instability, etc.). He is broadly
    interested in the evolutionary consequences of asexual vs sexual
    reproduction, models of neutral/non-neutral evolution, invasive species,
    polyploidy, and what fuels rapid adaptation.<br><br>

    As a PhD candidate, with a strong interest in gaining expertise in different
    bioinformatics approaches and their applications in Cardiovascular
    diseases, Mehak is deeply engaged in cutting-edge research endeavors aimed at
    understanding various types of Aortic acute diseases by integrating medical
    images, genomics and functional genomics aspects.<br><br>

    Before embarking on her PhD journey, Mehak had the valuable opportunity to delve into
    RNA-seq analysis during her Master’s thesis. She explored the correlation between
    diabetes and unhealthy heart using high-throughput sequencing datasets and
    found candidate biomarkers associated with coronary heart disease,
    hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.This experience provided her with a firm foundation
    in genomics as well as a thorough awareness of the complexities involved in
    studying complicated diseases at the molecular level.<br><br>

    Furthermore, she had the privilege of working as a Data Analyst in the Genome
    India project at the Centre for Brain Research, Indian Institute of Science.
    Here, she was actively involved in managing and analyzing genetic genotypic data
    from the Indian population. In the project, she also dedicated herself to
    identifying copy number variations and exploring the fascinating field of
    ancient genomics, which further fueled her enthusiasm to pursue a PhD.
